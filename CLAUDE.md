# Plexive

Open source social media app that replaces doomscrolling with valuable content.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python FastAPI
- Frontend: Next.js
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (connection via `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`)
- License: AGPL v3

## Content Model

Posts use a `sections` JSON array and a `feed_card` JSON object. The old per-format fields (`hook`, `key_points`, `details`, `body`, etc.) are removed.

- Full schema spec: `docs/content-structure/PLEXIVE_CONTENT_STRUCTURE.md`
- Books skeleton: `docs/content-structure/skeletons/books_skeleton.jsonc`
- Books example: `docs/content-structure/examples/books_example.json`
- Style guide: `docs/content-structure/STYLE_GUIDE_LONGFORM.md`

SVG security: `is_user_content=false` (seed/official) uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`; `is_user_content=true` (user submissions) uses a base64 `<img>` data URL. This applies in `SectionRenderer` (CoreIdeasSection, TakeawaySection) and `PostCard`.

## Rules
- All code comments in English
- No emojis in code or comments
- I am a beginner, briefly explain what you are doing and why
- Always ask before making changes outside the current task
- After every change, update ARCHITECTURE.md. One line per new or changed item. No explanations beyond what is already there — just add or update the relevant entry. Never let it grow into prose.
